**Insights:** According to the dataset, the initial order was placed on September 4, 2016, at 15:19:00 UTC, and the final order was placed on October 17, 2018, at 17:30:18 UTC. Customers from 5,812 cities and 27 states placed non-repeated orders between September 4, 2016, at 21:15:19 UTC, and October 17, 2018, at 17:30:18 UTC.<br>
#### In-depth Exploration:<br>
- **Growing trend in the no. of orders placed over the past years** <br>

**Insights:** We can see how many orders have been placed per year from the snapshot, but we cannot compute the percentage rise or compare it year to year because we do not have complete data on orders for the entire years of 2016 and 2018, as some months are missing.
-  **Monthly seasonality in terms of the no. of orders being placed** <br>
  ![image](https://github.com/IshanSarkar/Portfolio/assets/160044904/092ca751-6f4f-417b-a4f8-0fb4d280a24b)<br>

**Insights:** December 2016 is missing from the data collection. We can observe that the number of orders increased significantly in October 2016 compared to the previous month, but decreased significantly in December of the same year. Because of the forthcoming holiday season in the country, the biggest number of orders in 2017 was in November, and the lowest number of orders was in January. In addition, except the first quarter of 2017, the second month always has the highest number of orders in that quarter, followed by the third month. 2018 began with the highest number of orders in that year, and the number of orders remained very high throughout the year when compared to the previous year's months. The number of orders was extremely low in September and October of 2018.<br>

**Insights:** In 2018, there is an increase of 137% in the cost of orders. So, it could mean several meanings like an indication that the prices of the products being ordered have increased, or that customers are ordering more expensive items. It could also suggest that there is an increase in demand for the products being offered, which is driving up the prices.<br>

**Insights:** As per the result, Sao Paulo has the highest Total value of order price which is 5202955.05 and Paraiba has the highest average value of order price which is 191.48. This suggests that while Sao Paulo may have a larger volume of orders, the average value of each order in Paraiba is higher.<br>

### Overall Summary:<br>
The analysis of the provided insights reveals significant trends and patterns in the company's operations, encompassing order dynamics, geographic distribution, pricing strategies, shipping costs, and delivery efficiency. The data spans from September 4, 2016, to October 17, 2018, providing a comprehensive view of the company's performance during this period. Notably, there are some missing data points, particularly in December 2016, which limits the ability to make year-to-year comparisons accurately.<br>

### Business Recommendation:
- Given the observed fluctuations in order volumes across different months, the company should capitalize on peak seasons such as November, coinciding with the holiday season, by implementing targeted marketing campaigns and optimizing inventory management to meet increased demand effectively.
- The significant increase in the cost of orders in 2018 warrants a thorough examination of pricing strategies and product offerings. The company should analyze market trends, competitor pricing, and customer preferences to ensure competitive pricing and maximize profitability.
- With São Paulo consistently leading in order volumes and total order value, the company should prioritize marketing efforts and resource allocation in this region. However, attention should also be given to regions with high average order values, such as Paraíba, to capitalize on potentially lucrative markets.
- Analyzing freight values and delivery times across different states highlights opportunities for optimizing shipping processes and reducing costs. The company should focus on improving delivery efficiency, particularly in states where delivery times are comparatively longer, to enhance customer satisfaction and loyalty.
- Recognizing that most orders are made via credit card, followed by UPI, the company should ensure seamless payment processing and offer incentives or promotions to encourage the use of preferred payment methods.
- Given that most orders are made in a single installment, the company could explore opportunities to introduce flexible payment options, such as installment plans, to accommodate diverse customer preferences and increase order value.
- Identifying states with the fastest and slowest delivery times provides insights into areas for improvement. The company should strive to replicate the efficient delivery processes observed in states like Acre across its operations to enhance customer satisfaction and differentiate itself in the market.
